# Area of Interest Marking and Monitoring

This repository contains the implementation of a real-time monitoring tool developed as part of my **undergraduate thesis project**.

## Project Overview

The system allows a user to define a custom **Area of Interest (AoI)** directly on the screen (via mouse input). Once the area is marked, the tool continuously monitors the video feed and automatically **detects and alerts** when a person enters the defined region.

This solution was designed with practical applications in **security, surveillance, and restricted zone monitoring**, combining real-time video processing and human detection.

## Key Features:
- Interactive area marking using mouse input
- Real-time person detection using computer vision techniques
- Automated alerts triggered upon area violation
- Implementation using **Python**, **OpenCV** and **YOLO**
- Lightweight and adaptable to different video sources (e.g., webcam, IP camera)

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- YOLOv5

## Context
This tool was developed as the final project for my **Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science**, with the goal of applying computer vision techniques to real-world security challenges.
